# CloudIPAtlas

Automated collector for cloud provider IP ranges. Syncs daily with 14+ providers including AWS, Azure, GCP, and more.

Aggregates, organizes, and maintains up-to-date IP ranges from major cloud providers, CDNs, and network services. Perfect for firewall rules, security policies, and network automation.

**Note:** CloudIPAtlas uses official provider sources directly, not ASN databases. This ensures accuracy and includes provider-specific metadata (services, regions) that ASN databases don't provide.
